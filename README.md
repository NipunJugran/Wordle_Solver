Usage Guidelines:
1. Run the .py file in your terminal using python version 3 and above.
2. Open the Wordle game in a new browser.
3. Enter the first guess in the game based on the suggestion by the program.
4. Return the response from the game to the program by entering a 5 letter string of "g", "y" and "r" by the following convention:
   green -> "g"
   yellow -> "y"
   black -> "r" (black wasn't looking good in black blackground so used red color instead)
5. The program will display the current guess with the color scheme provided by you.
6. Another guess will be generated based on your response and keep repeating the steps 3 and 4 till you reach the answer.
7. To terminate the program, just enter a string of 5 "g"s signifying that the word is correct.


That's all, enjoy winning!
